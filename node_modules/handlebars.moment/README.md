### Using handlebars.moment in the browser

`handlebars.moment` is written using a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) pattern and itâ€™s preferable to load it using a module loader that supports [AMD](http://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/) modules (eg. [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [JSPM](http://jspm.io/)). This guarantees that its dependencies have been loaded before it is run.

However, if a window element is detected, the function returned by `handlebars.moment` is assigned to `HandlebarsMoment` in the global window context. This function needs to be called with `lodash` and `moment` as its arguments. The resulting object has the  `registerHelpers` which must then be called for `handlebars` to know about the helper.

    HandlebarsMoment(_, moment).registerHelpers(Handlebars);
